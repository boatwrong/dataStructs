Compare and contrast bubble sort, insertion sort and quicksort. Provide pros and cons of each and when they would/wouldn't be appropriate to use.

Quick sort is different from insertion sort and bubble sort because it is recursive.
In terms of time complexity, all three share the same worst case at O(n^2). For insertion sort and bubble sort, the best case time complexity is O(n) while the best case for quick sort is O(n * log(n)).
Quicksort is less likely to have worst case time complexity than insertion sort or bubble sort however.
The best use case for insertion sort or bubble sort would be a nearly sorted list while unsorted lists and a need for efficiency would warrant the use of quicksort.
