What are data structures?

Data structures are a manner in which memory is managed and utilized in a computer.

3 examples:

A set of usernames and passwords stored in a hash map for a high traffic website where fast lookup time for the usernames is important and usernames need to be unique.

A linked list is a useful data structure in an application where memory use is restricted instead of a predefined array.

A good use for an array is when working with a set of numbers that you need to do calculations on, such as max, min, avg, sum, etc.
