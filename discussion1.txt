Hello,

My name is Bryant Boatright, and I am studying mechanical engineering with a minor in computer science. I'm excited to become more comfortable in C/C++ while learning the different structures. I am currently not employed and just taking classes. My main hobby would be cooking, either learning new dishes or techniques is what I enjoy spending my free time doing.
